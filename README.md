# Conclusion 
Based on the analysis, we discovered that the data for Thomas High School 9th grade was compromised. Because of this we had to exclude all the data by making a NaN due to it distorting the following level analysis and not producing any significant impact on the overall summary. My advise would be to aim to obtain accurate data or utilize a proxy in order to estimate such data and create abetter performance of low level analysis.
